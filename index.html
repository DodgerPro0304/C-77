         LETS LEARN ABOUT CONSOLE AND VISUAL STUDIO
    </h1>
   

        <p style="color:blue"> What was the main purpose of console?
            A console traditionally refers to a computer terminal where a user may input commands and view output such as
            the results of inputted commands or status messages from the computer. The console is often connected to a
            remote computer or computer system that is controlled from the console.</p>
        
    <p2 style="color: red"> Visual Studio is a powerful developer tool that enables you to complete the entire development cycle in one
        place. It is a comprehensive integrated development environment (IDE) that you can use to write, edit, debug,
        and build code, and then publish your app. Beyond code editing and debugging, Visual Studio includes graphical
        designers, compilers, code completion tools, source control, extensions, and many more features to enhance every
        stage of the software development process.

        With the variety of features and languages support in Visual Studio, you can grow from writing your first "Hello
        World" program to developing and deploying apps. For example, you can build desktop and web apps with .NET,
        Mobile and gaming apps with C++.</p2>
